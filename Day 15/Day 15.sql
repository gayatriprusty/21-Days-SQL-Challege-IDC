#Day 15
-- Practice Questions:
-- 1. Join patients, staff, and staff_schedule to show patient service and staff availability.
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, s.staff_name, ss.week, ss.present FROM patients p JOIN staff s ON p.service = s.service
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id;
-- 2. Combine services_weekly with staff and staff_schedule for comprehensive service analysis.
SELECT sw.week, sw.service, sw.patients_admitted, sw.patients_refused, s.staff_name, ss.present FROM services_weekly sw LEFT JOIN staff s ON sw.service = s.service
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id AND sw.week = ss.week;
-- 3. Create a multi-table report showing patient admissions with staff information.
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, s.staff_name, s.role FROM patients p JOIN staff s ON p.service = s.service;

-- Daily Challenge Question: Create a comprehensive service analysis report for week 20 showing: service name, total patients
-- admitted that week, total patients refused, average patient satisfaction, count of staff assigned to service, and count of 
-- staff present that week. Order by patients admitted descending.
SELECT sw.service, sw.patients_admitted, sw.patients_refused, ROUND(AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_satisfaction,  
COUNT(DISTINCT s.staff_id) AS total_staff, SUM(CASE WHEN ss.present = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS staff_present FROM services_weekly sw 
LEFT JOIN staff s ON sw.service = s.service LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id AND sw.week = ss.week WHERE sw.week = 20
GROUP BY sw.service, sw.patients_admitted, sw.patients_refused, sw.patient_satisfaction ORDER BY sw.patients_admitted DESC;
