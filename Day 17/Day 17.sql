#Day 17
-- Practice Question 1. Show each patient with their service's average satisfaction as an additional column.
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, p.satisfaction AS patient_satisfaction, T2.avg_service_sat FROM patients AS p INNER JOIN(
SELECT sw.service, AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction) AS avg_service_sat FROM services_weekly AS sw GROUP BY sw.service) AS T2 ON p.service = T2.service;

-- Practice Question 2. Create a derived table of service statistics and query from it.
WITH ServiceStats AS ( SELECT sw.service, SUM(sw.patients_admitted) AS total_admitted, AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction) AS avg_satisfaction,
SUM(sw.patients_refused) AS total_refused FROM services_weekly AS sw GROUP BY sw.service)
SELECT ss.service, ss.total_admitted, ss.avg_satisfaction FROM ServiceStats AS SS WHERE ss.total_admitted > 500 ORDER BY ss.total_admitted DESC;      
    
-- Practice Question 3. Display staff with their service's total patient count as a calculated field.
SELECT s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.service, T2.total_admissions_for_service FROM staff AS s INNER JOIN( SELECT sw.service, 
SUM(sw.patients_admitted) AS total_admissions_for_service FROM services_weekly AS sw GROUP BY sw.service) AS T2 ON s.service = T2.service ORDER BY T2.total_admissions_for_service DESC;       
 
-- Daily Challenge Question: Create a report showing each service with: service name, total patients admitted, the difference between their 
-- total admissions and the average admissions across all services, and a rank indicator ('Above Average', 'Average', 'Below Average'). Order by total patients admitted descending.
WITH ServiceAdmissions AS ( SELECT sw.service, SUM(sw.patients_admitted) AS total_admitted FROM services_weekly AS sw GROUP BY sw.service), OverallAverage AS (SELECT AVG(total_admitted) 
AS avg_hospital_admissions FROM ServiceAdmissions) SELECT SA.service, SA.total_admitted, SA.total_admitted - OA.avg_hospital_admissions AS difference_from_average, 
CASE WHEN SA.total_admitted > OA.avg_hospital_admissions THEN 'Above Average' WHEN SA.total_admitted = OA.avg_hospital_admissions THEN 'Average' ELSE 'Below Average' 
END AS admission_rank FROM ServiceAdmissions AS SA CROSS JOIN OverallAverage AS OA ORDER BY SA.total_admitted DESC;
