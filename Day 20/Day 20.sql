#Day 20
-- Practice Question 1. Calculate running total of patients admitted by week for each service.
SELECT sw.service, sw.week, sw.patients_admitted, SUM(sw.patients_admitted) OVER (PARTITION BY sw.service ORDER BY sw.week ROWS 
BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total_admitted FROM services_weekly AS sw ORDER BY sw.service, sw.week;

-- Practice Question 2. Find the moving average of patient satisfaction over 4-week periods.
SELECT sw.service, sw.week, sw.patient_satisfaction, AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction) OVER (PARTITION BY sw.service ORDER BY sw.week
ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS four_week_moving_average_sat FROM services_weekly AS sw ORDER BY sw.service, sw.week;

-- Practice Question 3. Show cumulative patient refusals by week across all services.
SELECT sw.week, SUM(sw.patients_refused) AS weekly_refusals_total, SUM(SUM(sw.patients_refused)) OVER (ORDER BY sw.week ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
AS cumulative_hospital_refusals FROM services_weekly AS sw GROUP BY sw.week ORDER BY sw.week;

-- Daily Challenge Question: Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted, running total of patients admitted (cumulative), 
-- 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 prior weeks),and the difference between current week admissions and the service average. Filter for weeks 10-20 only.
